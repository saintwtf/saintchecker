# Saint Checker

**Saint Checker is a simple to use domain checker written in 100% python.**

**This makes it easier for people to check any domain without going to a specific one for a specific TLD.**

# Install

**This is a simple install, all you will have to do is have python (obviously)**

*Step's*

**Please do `pip install -r requirements.txt` which will install the requirments to run this file.**

**Then all you have to do is `python main.py` and it will run the checker.**

**Then from there all you do is enter a domain (EX: Saint.lol) and it will tell you if its taken or not**
